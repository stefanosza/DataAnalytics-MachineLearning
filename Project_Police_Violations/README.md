## Steps:
### 1. 📂 Data Loading

The dataset is loaded into a `DataFrame` for further processing.

### 2. 🧼 Data Cleaning

An initial check is performed for missing values and incorrect data types. Columns that are not useful or contain excessive missing data are removed, and some fields (e.g., dates) are converted to the appropriate types.

### 3. 🏷️ Transformations & Feature Creation

Simple transformations are applied, such as the creation of new categories (e.g., driver_age_group), to facilitate easier analysis and visualization.

### 4. 📊 Exploration & Analysis

The notebook is structured to support **statistical analysis and visualization** of the dataset. The goal is to identify patterns in police traffic stops.
